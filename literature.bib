    abstract = "{Objective To determine whether statistical and machine-learning methods, when applied to electronic health record (EHR) access data, could help identify suspicious (ie, potentially inappropriate) access to EHRs.Methods From EHR access logs and other organizational data collected over a 2-month period, the authors extracted 26 features likely to be useful in detecting suspicious accesses. Selected events were marked as either suspicious or appropriate by privacy officers, and served as the gold standard set for model evaluation. The authors trained logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) models on 10-fold cross-validation sets of 1291 labeled events. The authors evaluated the sensitivity of final models on an external set of 58 events that were identified as truly inappropriate and investigated independently from this study using standard operating procedures.Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the models on the whole data set of 1291 events was 0.91 for LR, and 0.95 for SVM. The sensitivity of the baseline model on this set was 0.8. When the final models were evaluated on the set of 58 investigated events, all of which were determined as truly inappropriate, the sensitivity was 0 for the baseline method, 0.76 for LR, and 0.79 for SVM.Limitations The LR and SVM models may not generalize because of interinstitutional differences in organizational structures, applications, and workflows. Nevertheless, our approach for constructing the models using statistical and machine-learning techniques can be generalized. An important limitation is the relatively small sample used for the training set due to the effort required for its construction.Conclusion The results suggest that statistical and machine-learning methods can play an important role in helping privacy officers detect suspicious accesses to EHRs.}",

	abstract="Many healthcare facilities enforce security on their electronic health records (EHRs) through a corrective mechanism: some staff nominally have almost unrestricted access to the records, but there is a strict ex post facto audit process for inappropriate accesses, i.e., accesses that violate the facility's security and privacy policies. This process is inefficient, as each suspicious access has to be reviewed by a security expert, and is purely retrospective, as it occurs after damage may have been incurred. This motivates automated approaches based on machine learning using historical data. Previous attempts at such a system have successfully applied supervised learning models to this end, such as SVMs and logistic regression. While providing benefits over manual auditing, these approaches ignore the identity of the users and patients involved in a record access. Therefore, they cannot exploit the fact that a patient whose record was previously involved in a violation has an increased risk of being involved in a future violation. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering inspired approach to predicting inappropriate accesses. Our solution integrates both explicit and latent features for staff and patients, the latter acting as a personalized ``fingerprint'' based on historical access patterns. The proposed method, when applied to real EHR access data from two tertiary hospitals and a file-access dataset from Amazon, shows not only significantly improved performance compared to existing methods, but also provides insights as to what indicates an inappropriate access.",

While organizations now invest millions of dollars in PHRs, the best PHR architectures, value propositions, and descriptions are not universally agreed upon. Despite widespread interest and activity, little PHR research has been done to date, and targeted research investment in PHRs appears inadequate. The authors reviewed the existing PHR specific literature (100 articles) and divided the articles into seven categories, of which four in particular—evaluation of PHR functions, adoption and attitudes of healthcare providers and patients towards PHRs, PHR related privacy and security, and PHR architecture—present important research opportunities. We also briefly discuss other research related to PHRs, PHR research funding sources, and PHR business models. We believe that additional PHR research can increase the likelihood that future PHR system deployments will beneficially impact healthcare costs, quality, and efficiency.}",

In addition, given the absence of a robust ROI literature base, we review the general benefits and potential costs of various health IT applications including electronic health records (EHRs), computerized physicians order entry (CPOE) systems, and clinical decision support systems (CDSS). We conclude that articles examining these benefits are much more common than studies examining ROI itself. This trend suggests the early stage of this knowledge base. Additional research utilizing broader perspectives and multidisciplinary techniques will be needed before a better understanding of ROI from health IT is achieved.",

	abstract = "Enabling the shared care paradigm, centralised or even decentralised electronic health record (EHR) systems increasingly become core applications in hospital information systems and health networks. For realising multipurpose use and reuse as well as inter-operability at knowledge level, EHR have to meet special architectural requirements. The component-oriented and model-based architecture should meet international standards. Especially in extended health networks realising inter-organisational communication and co-operation, authorisation cannot be organised at user level anymore. Therefore, models, methods and tools must be established to allow formal and structured policy definition, policy agreements, role definition, authorisation and access control. Based on the author’s international engagement in EHR architecture and security standards referring to the revision of CEN ENV 13606, the GEHR/open EHR approach, HL7 and CORBA, models for health-specific and EHR-related roles, for authorisation management and access control have been developed. The basic concept is the separation of structural roles defining organisational entity-to-entity relationships and enabling specific acts on the one hand, and functional roles bound to specific activities and realising rights and duties on the other hand. Aggregation of organisational, functional, informational and technological components follows specific rules. Using UML and XML, the principles as well as some examples for analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of policy and authorisation management as well as access control have been practically implemented."

	abstract={In healthcare, role-based access control systems are often extended with exception mechanisms to ensure access to needed information even when the needs don't follow the expected patterns. Exception mechanisms increase the threats to patient privacy, and therefore their use should be limited and subject to auditing. We have studied access logs from a hospital EPR system with extensive use of exception-based access control. We found that the uses of the exception mechanisms were too frequent and widespread to be considered exceptions. The huge size of the log and the use of pre-defined or uninformative reasons for access make it infeasible to audit the log for misuse. The informative reasons that were given provided starting points for requirements on how the usage needs should be accomplished without exception-based access. With more structured and fine-grained logging, analysis of access logs could be a very useful tool for learning how to reduce the need for exception-based access.},

	title={Detecting Anomalous User Behaviors in Workflow-Driven Web Applications},

	abstract={Web applications are increasingly used as portals to interact with back-end database systems and support business processes. This type of data-centric workflow-driven web application is vulnerable to two types of security threats. The first is an request integrity attack, which stems from the vulnerabilities in the implementation of business logic within web applications. The second is guideline violation, which stems from privilege misuse in scenarios where business logic and policies are too complex to be accurately defined and enforced. Both threats can lead to sequences of web requests that deviate from typical user behaviors. The objective of this paper is to detect anomalous user behaviors based on the sequence of their requests within a web session. We first decompose web sessions into workflows based on their data objects. In doing so, the detection of anomalous sessions is reduced to detection of anomalous workflows. Next, we apply a hidden Markov model (HMM) to characterize workflows on a per-object basis. In this model, the implicit business logic involved in this object defines the unobserved states of the Markov process, where the web requests are observations. To derive more robust HMMs, we extend the object-specific approach to an object-cluster approach, where objects with similar workflows are clustered and HMM models are derived on a per-cluster basis. We evaluate our models using two real systems, including an open source web application and a large web-based electronic medical record system. The results show that our approach can detect anomalous web sessions and lend evidence to suggest that the clustering approach can achieve relatively low false positive rates while maintaining its detection accuracy.},
